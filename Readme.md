# Task
# Re-create four plots which plot the energy consumption over a 2 day period in 2007 (1 Feb through 2 Feb)
# Submit 
# 1) the code to create the plots and 2) the PNG file of the plots
# Data
# Electric Power Consumption from the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository
# There were originally 9 variables from the UCI dataset:
# Date: Date in format dd/mm/yyyy
# Time: time in format hh:mm:ss
# Global_active_power: household global minute-averaged active power (in kilowatt)
# Global_reactive_power: household global minute-averaged reactive power (in kilowatt)
# Voltage: minute-averaged voltage (in volt)
# Global_intensity: household global minute-averaged current intensity (in ampere)
# Sub_metering_1: energy sub-metering No. 1 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to the kitchen, containing mainly a dishwasher, an oven and a microwave (hot plates are not electric but gas powered).
# Sub_metering_2: energy sub-metering No. 2 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to the laundry room, containing a washing-machine, a tumble-drier, a refrigerator and a light.
# Sub_metering_3: energy sub-metering No. 3 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to an electric water-heater and an air-conditioner.

# Which have been converted to 8 variables once the Date and Time fields were collapsed into 1 field as such:

# Date/Time: Posixct datatype in UTC
# Global_active_power: household global minute-averaged active power (in kilowatt)
# Global_reactive_power: household global minute-averaged reactive power (in kilowatt)
# Voltage: minute-averaged voltage (in volt)
# Global_intensity: household global minute-averaged current intensity (in ampere)
# Sub_metering_1: energy sub-metering No. 1 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to the kitchen, containing mainly a dishwasher, an oven and a microwave (hot plates are not electric but gas powered).
# Sub_metering_2: energy sub-metering No. 2 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to the laundry room, containing a washing-machine, a tumble-drier, a refrigerator and a light.
# Sub_metering_3: energy sub-metering No. 3 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to an electric water-heater and an air-conditioner.
